# dot files
Lists configuration files that I use commonly in Linux.


## Getting started
Clone this repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Vomet/dot-files
```

After, you can move files to their respective locations.

Alternatively, you can use `wget` or `curl` to overwrite files in new Linux installations.
